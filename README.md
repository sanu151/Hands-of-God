    - Offers real-time database, authentication, and hosting.
    - Ideal for real-time multiplayer games.
  - **Node.js**:
    - A JavaScript runtime for building scalable backend services.
    - Works well with WebSockets for real-time communication.
    - Offers more control and customization compared to Firebase.
  - **WebSockets**:
    - A protocol for real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers.
    - Perfect for real-time multiplayer games.
- **Key Features**:
  - Real-time data synchronization.
  - Scalability for handling multiple players.
  - Easy integration with frontend platforms.
