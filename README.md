   - Verify that dots are generated within the correct boundaries (player areas).
   - Ensure dots appear and disappear after 1 second.
2. **Scoring Logic**:
   - Test if the score increments correctly when a player taps a dot.
   - Verify that tapping a dot in the opponent’s area awards or deducts points as intended.
3. **Touch Detection**:
   - Test if touch coordinates are detected accurately.
   - Ensure only the first player to tap a dot gets the point.

#### **Tools**:
- **Android**: Use **JUnit** and **Mockito** for unit testing in Android Studio.
- **iOS**: Use **XCTest** for unit testing in Xcode.
- **Web**: Use **Jest** or **Mocha** for JavaScript unit testing.

#### **Example: Android Unit Test for Scoring**
```kotlin
class GameLogicTest {
    @Test
    fun testScoreIncrement() {
        val gameLogic = GameLogic()
        gameLogic.onDotTapped(playerId = 1)
        assertEquals(1, gameLogic.getPlayerScore(playerId = 1))
    }
}
```

---

### **2. Integration Testing**
Integration testing ensures that different components of the game work together as expected.

#### **What to Test**:
1. **Multiplayer Functionality**:
   - Test room creation and joining.

2. **Firebase Integration**:
   - Test if player data (e.g., scores, room IDs) is stored and retrieved correctly.
   - Ensure real-time updates work as intended.
3. **UI/UX Integration**:
   - Test if animations and sound effects trigger correctly during gameplay.

#### **Tools**:
- **Android**: Use **Espresso** for UI testing in Android Studio.
- **iOS**: Use **XCUITest** for UI testing in Xcode.
- **Web**: Use **Cypress** or **Selenium** for end-to-end testing.

#### **Example: Firebase Integration Test**
```kotlin
@Test
fun testRoomCreation() {
    val database = Firebase.database
    val roomRef = database.getReference("rooms").push()
    roomRef.setValue(Room(roomId = roomRef.key, player1 = "Player1", player2 = null))
    assertNotNull(roomRef.key)
